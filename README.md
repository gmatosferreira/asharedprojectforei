## Technologies and libraries

As we believe in a shared project, we only used open-source or freely available technologies.

## Run it at your computer!

You can run this app on your computer with just a few steps.

Start by installing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

```bash
# If you are using Linux
$ sudo apt install npm
# Check if it was installed
$ npm -v
```

Once you've installed it, just got the root folder of the app (where the file package.json is) and install the package and dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

You can now run the app with a simple command! :)

```bash
$ npm start
```

Feel free to change and adapt it to your needs!
